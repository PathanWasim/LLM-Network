## Requirements

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Node.js (for neural interface)
- Ollama (for neural LLM capabilities)

## Quick Start

### 🚀 **Recommended: Build from Source** (Avoids Antivirus Issues)

1. **Install Prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   # Install Rust
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   
   # Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
   ```

2. **Clone and Build:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PathanWasim/LLM-Network.git
   cd LLM-Network
   
   # Build NeuroMesh
   cargo build --release
   
   # Build Web Interface
   cd webpage && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
   ```

3. **Start NeuroMesh:**
   ```bash
   start-neuromesh.bat
   ```

4. **Access Neural Interface:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/app/
   ```

### 📦 **Alternative: Pre-built Release** (May trigger antivirus)

If you prefer pre-built binaries, download from [Releases](https://github.com/PathanWasim/LLM-Network/releases) and add to antivirus exclusions.

## Neural Architecture

- **Neural TCP Layer**: Handles neural node connections and neural message passing
- **Neural UDP Layer**: Manages neural node discovery and mesh broadcasts  
- **Neural LLM Core**: Interfaces with Ollama for neural language model capabilities
- **Neural Interface**: Advanced React-based neural control interface with particle effects

## License

MIT License 
## 🛡️
 Antivirus False Positive Notice

**NeuroMesh may be flagged by antivirus software** due to:
- Network port usage (TCP/UDP communication)
- Unsigned executable (digital certificates cost $100-300/year)
- New software signature

### Solutions:
1. **Build from source** (recommended) - completely safe
2. **Add antivirus exclusions** - see [ANTIVIRUS_GUIDE.md](ANTIVIRUS_GUIDE.md)
3. **Verify checksums** - available in GitHub releases
4. **Review source code** - fully open source for transparency

### For Developers:
```bash
# Generate checksum for verification
certutil -hashfile target\release\neuromesh.exe SHA256
```

**NeuroMesh is 100% safe** - it's a legitimate peer-to-peer AI network application with open source code.
