      "content": "Certainly! Below is a simple C program that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard input-output library which is necessary for using the `printf` function.\n- `int main()`: This is the entry point of the program. Every C program must have a `main` function.\n- `printf(\"Hello, World!\\n\");`: This line prints the string \"Hello, World!\" to the console. The `\\n` at the end of the string is a newline character that moves the cursor to the next line after printing.\n- `return 0;`: This statement indicates that the program ended successfully.\n\nTo compile and run this program, you can use a C compiler like `gcc`. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Save the code in a file named `hello.c`.\n2. Open your terminal or command prompt.\n3. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello.c`.\n4. Compile the program using the following command:\n   ```sh\n   gcc hello.c -o hello\n   ```\n5. Run the compiled program using:\n   ```sh\n   ./hello\n   ```\n\nYou should see \"Hello, World!\" printed in your console.",
